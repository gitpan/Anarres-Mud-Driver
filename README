NAME
    Anarres::Mud::Driver - A game driver for LP Muds.

SYNOPSIS
      use Anarres::Mud::Driver;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an EXPERIMENTAL LP Mud driver written in Perl. The principle is
    to parse the LPC as would a traditional driver, build and typecheck a
    parse tree, then generate Perl source code from the parse tree. More
    traditional drivers would here generate and interpret bytecode.

    Generated Perl code is in a package namespace generated from the LPC
    filename of the object to be compiled.

    This program contains some interesting curiosities, such as an emulation
    for a full 'C' style switch statement in Perl.

USAGE
    The system is developer only and the interface changes quite rapidly. A
    good place to start is probably reading the test files. For more
    information, see 'SUPPORT' below.

BUGS
    Incomplete. Experimental. Probably broken.

SUPPORT
    Speak to Arren on the Anarres II LP mud (telnet mudlib.anarres.org 5000)
